<P style = "font-size:22px;text-align:justify">Everybody knows the <strong><I>Pythogorean theorem</I></strong>. If not or if you want more interesting information, look at
<A href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagorean_theorem">Wikipedia: Pythagorean theorem</A> [last seen 2023-09-22]. We draw squares over both of the short sides of a rectangular triangle. Then we take the sides of the squares opposite to the sides belonging to the triangle as new hypotenuses, and we construct two new smaller triangles. (In a rectangular triangle the side opposite to the right angle is called hypotenuse, see

The procedure described can be continued, and this way we get a lot of rectangular triangles with with squares at their short sides. This can be repeated until a certain short length of the hypotenuse is reached. The drawing using <em>turtlegraphics</em> looks like some kind of an abstract tree.

The code is written in Python 3.9. Function “tree” contains two <em>recursive calls</em> so that each triangle branches into two smaller triangles if possible.
