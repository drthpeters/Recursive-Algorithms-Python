<P><H3>
What is a <I>recursive algorithm</I>? The answer can be found in chapter 1.
<P>
<I>Turtlegraphics</I> is a tool <P>with which nice graphics can be created
by recursive algorithms.
<P>
Considering some <I>mathematical applications</I> recursive algorithms<P>
and corresponding iterative algorithms are compared.
<P>
Things get a bit more difficult if there is <I>more than one
recursive call</I>.<P> It is even possible that there are recursive 
functions that call each other. <P>
Don't miss the <I>exercises</I>. For comparisons the <I>solutions</I> are available.
